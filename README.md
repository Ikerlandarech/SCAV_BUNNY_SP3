# SCAV VIDEO LAB 3
### EXERCISE 1: Changing bbb RESOLUTION and CODECS:
With the following command we can convert the bbb original resolution to 1280x720, 640x480, 320x240 & 160x120:
```ruby
python3 sp3.py --convert_video_resolution
```
With the following command we can change the original bbb h264 codec to VP8, VP9, h265 & AV1:
```ruby
python3 sp3.py --convert_video_codec
```

### EXERCISE 2: Exporting 2 video comparison:
Finally we can export 2 video comparisons with 2 different codecs with the following command:
```ruby
python3 sp3.py --compare_videos CODEC1 CODEC2
```
For instance:
```ruby
python3 sp3.py --compare_videos vp8 vp9
python3 sp3.py --compare_videos h265 av1 
```


### EXERCISE 3: üê∞üíïü¶ã - Bunny GUI! - üê∞üíïü¶ã:
This exercise is pure magic, by running the script BunnyGUI.py we will be able to talk with our well known Bunny friend. I've been working with him during the whole course and he is super friendly and loves to help me with ffmpeg commands, I know he looks kind of silly but he is an expert on that topic since he has been part of all our input_videos during the course, so he knows by heart all the ffmpeg commands that exist on the world. Please remember to not ask him about rufians, he has been having some problems with them lately since they've been killing butterflies, and we all love butterflies. Our Bunny friend here loves butterflies like nothing else in the world so you can talk with him about them too. Don't be shy ask him all the questions you have on the subject.
A demo has been provided via AulaGlobal too.

Keep in mind: This program would need a little more development, both in terms of reinforcement techniques to handle the behaviour of our friend, as the processing part, I have been working very hard on creating workers and threads with QRunneable to perform the processes that use the API in parallel to the frontend processes but I ended up not using them since they gave tons of errors of operations.

### EXERCISE 4: Docker:
Finally on this exercise I have simply created my first Dockerfile a build a container that contains FFMPEG to run a simple CMD command.
